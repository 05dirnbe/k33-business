##### Q: What is the name of your business and what is its mission?

[ITELL.SOLUTIONS GmbH](https://itell.solutions/) - It is our mission to create an environment in which businesses and customers can communicate openly with each other to their mutal benefit.

##### Q: How did you end up where you are today?

During my studies, I worked intensively with two colleagues on the subject of customer feedback and then we developed a digital solution together. Based on the good feedback, we started a company and aligned our digital product around the topics of customer loyalty, new customer acquisition and feedback. Our customers receive more and more loyal customers and can use their feedback to improve their operations sustainably.

##### Q: What are the best parts of your day to day work?

Working with people. A business is nothing more than a network of individuals that are in various relations with each other. My favorite thing is to grow this network.

##### Q: What keeps you motivated?

To learn something new, to broaden your horizons and to find a big picture behind many small points.

##### Q: What are your personal principles and values?

Treat people the way you want them to treat you!

##### Q: What does success look like to you?

Success for me is that you create added value. That is why I am particularly interested in the functioning and sustainable triangular relationship between our company, our customers and their customers. Only if all 3 parties can act in a fair and sensible interplay of give and take is it a success for me!

##### Q: What helps you grow personally?

My friends and colleagues, my girlfriend and my family have all brought me to where I am today and continue to have a positive impact on my personal development. My involvement in the ambulance service, which has been going on for over 10 years, has accompanied me in my development and also made it clear that some people are in a very bad spot and also showed destinies where everything changes overnight. This also leads to more appreciation of one's own living conditions and being thankful for opportunities that not all have.

##### Q: How du you recharge your batteries?

In addition to my girlfriend and family, many different hobbies, both in the musical and in the sporting area, help me to forget the world around me and to start the day with new energy.

##### Q: What else do you want to accomplish in your career?

Soccer is a great passion of mine. It is therefore a good idea to make soccer-related topics part of the job during your career. I don't know yet what exactly that will look like.
