##### Q: What is the name of your business and what is its mission?

We are [FRAISS IT GmbH](https://fraiss.com) and we have been implementing digital processes, products and services for more than 10 years. We think alongside our customers from the start - regardless of the maturity phase of the project - the project with a 360 Â° technical perspective.

##### Q: How did you end up where you are today?

My path started when I was 14, with a passion for IT and the first jobs I got when I was 17. Later came my studies, then co-founder and growth ... and in between a lot of patience, perseverance and the right people in my life.

##### Q: What are the best parts of your day to day work?

The variety and meeting new people every day. I'm a passionate networker (laughs).

##### Q: What keeps you motivated?

The cohesion in the FRAISS team, the perspective of building many companies and devoting myself to the things that give me fun and joy.

##### Q: What are your personal principles and values?

Honesty & directness. Openness. Curiosity.

##### Q: What does success look like to you?

To start every day and not to see the work as work, but to be able to do that that fills you with passion.

##### Q: What helps you grow personally?

The exchange with people, to think outside the box and to pursue new ideas again and again - and to implement them.

##### Q: How du you recharge your batteries?

My partner, who is also self-employed (laughs), nature and sometimes just rest and relaxation.

##### Q: What else do you want to accomplish in your career?

I want to move people, bring sustainable products to the market and get others excited about technology.
