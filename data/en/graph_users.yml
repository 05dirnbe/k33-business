    title : Graphs simplify managing structured data of any kind!
    description : >

      Simply **model your use cases as graphs** and exploit the power of graph libraries or graph databases to **efficiently transform,
      store and access your structured data**.
      The natural flexibility of the graph model makes it easy to **adapt to changing application requirements**.

      This flexibility is responsible for the many graph applications found in practice.
      Examples include: The **provisioning of connected Information** in social networks like LinkedIn or Facebook,
      the **implementation of complex systems** consisting of interconnected sensors or simply the **organization of connected data** whose complex structure
      makes using it in tabular form inefficient.

    title : Graphs enable the analysis of structured data of any kind!
    description : >

      Representing complex data as a graph opens up **powerful analysis and visualizationalization possibilities**.
      It simply is intuitive and fun to explore data that is given as a graph.

      **Try for yourself, zoom in and interact with the complicated-looking graph next to this text**. What is this data about? Hint: Nodes are players and edges illustrated the "who with whom".

      Applications of graphs in **data science and visualization tasks** appear organically when the **connection between data points become more important** that the points themselves.
      Examples for this include the analysis of social networks or the **visualization of complex processes** of various sorts.

    title : Graphs uncover the essential relations between the entities that drive your success!
    description : >
      Your operation uses structured data and processes aiming to get the **maximum use** out of them.
      However, **proper data management requires strategies** to meet various challenges connected to the handling of data.
      Decision makers and visionaries are challenged to understand and keep track of the bigger picture.
      **Thinking in terms of graphs and deploying graph concepts** offer additional tools to keep up with the complexity of such challenges and enable better decision-making.
