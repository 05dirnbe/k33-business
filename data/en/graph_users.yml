      Simply model your use cases as graphs and exploit the power of graph libraries or graph databases to efficiently transform,
      store and access your structured data.
      The natural flexibility of the graph model makes it easy to adapt to changing application requirements.

      This flexibility is responsible for the many forms graph applications take in practice.
      Examples include: The provisioning of personalized Information in social networks like LinkedIn or Facebook,
      the implementation of complex systems consisting of interconnected sensors or simply the organization of data whose complex structure
      makes using it in tabular form inefficient.

    title : ... you write code analyzing structured data of any kind!
    description : >

      Representing complex data as a graph opens up powerful analysis and visualizationalization possibilities.
      It simply is intuitive and fun to explore data that is given as a graph.

      Try for yourself, zoom in and interact with the complicated-looking graph next to this text. What is this data about?

      Applications of graphs in data science and visualization tasks appear organically when the connection between data points become as important
      or even more important that the points themselves.
      Examples for this include the analysis of social networks or the visualization of complex processes of various sorts.

    title : ... you don't write code but structured data is still important to your success!
    description : >
      Your operation uses structured data aiming to get the maximum use out of it.
      However, proper data management requires strategies to meet various challenges connected to the handling of data.
      Decision makers and visionaries are challenged to understand and keep track of the bigger picture.
      Thinking in terms of graphs and deploying graph concepts offer additional tools to keep up with the complexity of such challenges.
