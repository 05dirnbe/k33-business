title     : What are Graphs?
subtitle  : >
  A mathematical graph, or **graph** for short, is a **structure representing pairwise relationships between objects**.
  A graph is made up of **vertices, nodes, or points** which are connected by **edges, arcs, or lines**.
  In practical applications the term **network** is often used instead of graphs.


  Once an application or a problem is transformed to the graph model, **powerful concepts, algorithms and analysis techniques** from [Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) and [Network Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science) immediately apply.
  For this reason and their wide applicability, **graphs and technologies based on graphs have become key elements of many important applications** today.
  See [Applications](applications) for a curated list of what we regard as some of the most important of them.


  The following example shows how using a graph can help us **make better sense of structured data**.
  In this case, we look at a simple **communication network**, i.e. people sending emails to each other.
  However, it is important to emphasize that **virtually
  everything can be seen as a graph**.


  **Finding the correct way to model data as a graph and make maximum use of it in an application is an important and interesting problem.**

      Data capturing the exchange of emails between people can be directly represented as the graph seen here in blue.


      We have 10 unique persons forming the set of nodes.
      For each pair of people that exchanged emails with each other an edge is drawn between their respective nodes.
      The sum of these edges constitutes the set of edges. Nodes and edges together form a graph, in this case a communication network.


      Due to the graph representation interesting information is directly available:
      The best connected communicator in the graph is Alston with 5 neighbours.
      Coley and Langdon stick to themselves while Algie has no contacts at all.


      While this is a small and simple network, it is not difficult to see the similarity to large complex networks like Facebook or LinkedIn.
      In both cases it is the graph model that enables the efficient extraction and use of information.

      The node set is highlighted in red. Additional information is embedded in this graph drawing:
      The size of a node reflects the total number of mails exchanged with its direct neighbours.
      If you hover over individual nodes the total number of mails is given.


      In this example nodes represent people. However, nodes are abstract objects and can represent any entity.
      Multiple classes of nodes are common in many graphs.


      In prominent graphs nodes represent websites, devices, products, customers, messages, events, locations and the list goes on.

      The edge set is highlighted in red. Additional information is embedded in this graph drawing:
      The thickness of an edge reflects the number of mails exchanged between the two nodes it connects.
      If you hover over individual edges the number of mails is given.


      In this example edges represent email exchange. However, edges are abstract objects and can represent any relation.
      Multiple classes of edges are common in many graphs.
      Edges may also express a directed relation.


      In prominent graphs edges represent weblinks, connections, buying decisions, selling decisions, subscriptions, time-ordering, streets and the list goes on.
