      k-33 distinguishes itself through several years of experience in combining theoretical and practical aspects of using graphs.
      This includes concepts, algorithms and models that are used both in research as well as in industrial settings.


      The combination of theory and practical knowledge often yields the most promising solutions that work reliably in the long run.

      We believe that constant effort is required to truly maintain an expert status.
      The technical topics that we love are ever-developing and in constant flux. Staying on top of new developments is vital for us as experts.


      For this reason frequent extension, renewal and improvement of our own knowledge and methods is a critical part of our business.
      Challinging and pushing ourselves and our level of expertise constantly is very important to us.

      The true value of knowledge shows when it is shared. Providing our customers with the knowledge they need to succeed is vital to us.
      Teaching goes both ways however, we are always looking to learn what our customers have to share.


      Learning and teaching are at the heart of k-33.
      Many years of teaching engagements in university underlines our commitment to sharing what we know.


      In fact, we believe that a true expert should always be ready to contribute by sharing his or her knowlegde or experince in their field of expertise.
