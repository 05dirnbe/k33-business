      We were working together on a research project that required an interdisciplinary approach from computer science, biology, electrical engineering, and physics. Michael was crucial for the success of this project: His skills combine creative out-of-the-box thinking and thoroughly thought through solutions with a self-organized and timely work schedule that I could completely rely on. I can only highly recommend him!
