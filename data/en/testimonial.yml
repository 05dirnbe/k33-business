      We were working together on a research project that required an interdisciplinary approach from computer science, biology, electrical engineering, and physics. Michael was crucial for the success of this project: His skills combine creative out-of-the-box thinking and thoroughly thought through solutions with a self-organized and timely work schedule that I could completely rely on. I can only highly recommend him!

      For almost a year I collaborated with Michael on several projects. I quickly learned to appreciate his opinion and expert statements. They were always clear, precise, well-founded and unbiased with regards to wishful thinking. Open development and expert discussions always yielded a better understanding of the problem at hand and frequently lead to actionable solution strategies. In addition to that, given the fact that Michael and I have different special knowledge, I was able to learn a lot from him. On top of central ideas he frequently showed me best-practice approaches.

      I collaborated with Michael in the course of a project focused on analyzing the flow of people in an urban region. Possible changes between different modes of transport (driving and walking) posed a central challenge to the project. Michael contributed crucially to the development of solution concepts based on Graph Theory. In addition to his technical expertise I quickly learned to appreciate his deliberate and carful way of working and his unreserved willingness to help.

      It is a good idea to have Michael on your team. And it is a better idea to have him on your team in the early stages of your project. The questions he asked did help me understand the problems I wanted to solve. In a sense, Michael brings some very valuable Anti-Scrum to projects. He wants to find the definition of a problem, and then a good solution. While working on a project involving Graphs, and an ETL-pipeline for GIS data, I have learned A LOT, both conceptual and technical. I still use the lessons learned today on other projects. My employer should definitely be happy about the added value that Michael planted in our company, and I am, too, because working with him has been motivating and fun.

      I had the great pleasure of working with Michael on an innovative project in the insurance domain. We were looking into an opportunity to help life insurers accelerate modernization of their IT platforms using statistical algorithms in the data migration processes. Michael did a great job structuring the problem and nailing down the key success factors for our ideas to work. We are currently testing the solution with a couple of major players in Germany. To whomever this concerns – go and grab what Michaels has to offer: creativity, commitment and great teaming. My big recommendation!

      I met Dr. Michael Dirnberger in a project with focus on optimization. Practical methods were applied to the area of insurance applications, however, the selected methods have a wide range of useful applications in other domains as well. Michael's scientific expertise and personal strengths soon began to shine in various ways. Examples are the selection of mathematical solution-strategies, the planning of technical implementations as well as his interaction with other team members with whom Michael practices a critical, straight-forward, constructive and goal-oriented approach to the problem at hand. Without reservation, I thus recommend Michael's engagement in all mentioned areas and beyond!
