      We were working together on a research project that required an interdisciplinary approach from computer science, biology, electrical engineering, and physics. Michael was crucial for the success of this project: His skills combine creative out-of-the-box thinking and thoroughly thought through solutions with a self-organized and timely work schedule that I could completely rely on. I can only highly recommend him!

      For almost a year I collaborated with Michael on several projects. I quickly learned to appreciate his opinion and expert statements. They were always clear, precise, well-founded and unbiased with regards to wishful thinking. Open development and expert discussions always yielded a better understanding of the problem at hand and frequently lead to actionable solution strategies. In addition to that, given the fact that Michael and I have different special knowledge, I was able to learn a lot from him. On top of central ideas he frequently showed me best-practice approaches.

      I collaborated with Michael in the course of a project focused on analyzing the flow of people in an urban region. Possible changes between different modes of transport (driving and walking) posed a central challenge to the project. Michael contributed crucially to the development of solution concepts based on Graph Theory. In addition to his technical expertise I quickly learned to appreciate his deliberate and carful way of working and his unreserved willingness to help.
