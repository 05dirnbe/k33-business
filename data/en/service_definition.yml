    title     : Why are graphs interesting?
    description: >

      Graphs and technologies based on graphs allow us to work with arbitrary connected information in a structured and effecient manner.
      Due to their high level of abstraction, graphs can be used across a spectrum of different situations in a variety of different way.
      As a result graphs can be useful to almost everyone.


      In our keynotes we intorduce the concept of graphs and demonstrate their advantages using practical applications


      After our talks we'd like to hear our audience say something along the lines of:


      **"Yeah, I've got a new perspective regarding the use of connected information. I now see the guiding principle behind it."**


      To achieve this, we answer a number of core questions regarding graphs. These could look as follows:
