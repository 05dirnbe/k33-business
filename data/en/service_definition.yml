    title     : Why are graphs interesting?
    description: >

      Graphs and technologies based on graphs allow us to work with arbitrary connected information in a structured and efficient manner.
      Due to their high level of abstraction, graphs can be used across a spectrum of different situations in a variety of different way.
      As a result, graphs can be useful to almost everyone.


      In our keynotes we introduce the concept of graphs and demonstrate their advantages using practical applications


      After our talks we'd like to hear our audience say something along the lines of:


      **"Yeah, I've got a new perspective regarding the use of structured data. I now see the guiding principle behind it."**


      To achieve this, we introduce and answer a number of key questions regarding graphs. These could look as follows:
