      k-33 distinguishes itself through several years of experience in combining theoretical and practical aspects of using graphs.
      This includes concepts, algorithms and models that are used both in research as well as in industrial settings.


      The combination of theory and practical knowledge often yields the most promising solutions that work reliably in the long run.

      The true value of knowledge shows when it is shared. Providing our customers with the knowledge they need to succeed is vital to us.
      Teaching goes both ways however, we are always looking to learn what our customers have to share.


      Learning and teaching are at the heart of k-33.
      Many years of teaching engagements in university underlines our commitment to sharing what we know.


      In fact, we believe that a true expert should always be ready to contribute by sharing his or her knowlegde or experince in their field of expertise.

    title     : Outlook
    heading   : Beyond graphs
    content   : >

      Deep specialization is vital for experts, however, there is a danger to tunne too hard.
      Graphs for example, rarely exist or are used in isolation.


      More often than not, the usage of graphs in realistic application is coupled to other systems, such as databases, webservice or similar.


      Thus our experts must be knowledgabe beyond graphs, allowing for an efficient connection between graphs and the rest of the world.
      In this context k-33 is extremely proud to offer its customers significant competence in the areas of Data Science, Data Engineering and Software Engineering.
