      k33 distinguishes itself through several years of experience in **combining theoretical and practical aspects of using graphs**.
      This includes concepts, algorithms and models that are used both in research and in industrial settings.


      We firmly believe that the **combination of theory and practical knowledge** often yields the most promising solutions that **work reliably in the long run**.

      We believe that constant learning is required to truly maintain an expert status.
      The technical topics that we love are ever-developing and in constant flux. Staying on top of new developments is vital for us as experts.


      For this reason frequent extension, **renewal and improvement of our own knowledge and methods is a critical part of our business**.
      Challenging and pushing ourselves and our level of expertise constantly is second nature for us.

    title     : Complementary Knowledge
    heading   : Tunnel vision?! No, thanks.
    content   : >

      Deep specialization is vital for experts, however, there is a danger to tunnel too hard.
      Graphs for example, rarely exist or are used in isolation.


      **More often than not, the usage of graphs in realistic applications is coupled to other systems, such as databases, webservice or similar applications.**


      Thus we believe that our experts must be knowledgabe beyond graphs, allowing for an efficient connection between graphs and the rest of the world.
      In this context k33 is extremely proud to offer its customers significant competence in the areas of **Data Science, Data Engineering and Software Engineering**.
