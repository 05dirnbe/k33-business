      My name is **Michael Dirnberger**.


      Interest and enthusiasm have kept me working with graphs and their applications for many years.
      Today, via my company k33 Experts, I share my experience and knowledge with those seeking to utilize graphs themselves.


      I have studied [theoretical physics](https://physik.uni-graz.at/en/fachbereich-theoretische-physik/) at the [Karl-Franzens University](https://www.uni-graz.at/en/) in beautiful Graz, Austria.


      After that I was privileged to go to SaarbrÃ¼cken, Germany to complete a PhD in Computer Science at the [Max Planck Insititut for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/de/home/). My PhD Avisor was [Prof. Dr. mult. Kurt Mehlhorn](http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~mehlhorn/), an internationally acclaimed expert on the topic of Algorithms and Graphs.


      During my interdisciplinary PhD research I had ample oppurtunity to study the **theoretical and practical aspects of graphs** and was able to succesfully apply my knowledge in **both research and teaching**.

            After the completion of my PhD i decided to transfer the knoweledge and experience gained from academia to an industrial setting.


            I started out as a Senior Data Scientist working for [Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) specialist [Kiana Systems](http://www.kiana-systems.com/).
            A little later I found myself working in the [Advanced Analytics Division](https://home.kpmg.com/de/de/home/dienstleistungen/advisory/consulting/data-analytics-kpmg-lighthouse/advanced-analytics.html) of [KPMG Lighthouse Germany](https://home.kpmg.com/de/de/home/dienstleistungen/advisory/consulting/data-analytics-kpmg-lighthouse.html)


            Soon I realized the **enourmous potential** of applying graphs and technologies based on graphs in an **industrial setting**. Unfortunately, due to a **general lack of expert knowledge** this potential is **hardly being explored, save realized**.
